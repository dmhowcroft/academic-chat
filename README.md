# academic-chat

Mart√≠n Villalba, Timothee Mickus, and Dave Howcroft's INLG 2018 hackathon repo

For the INLG 2018 hackathon, we're using flow.ai to develop a chatbot for our academic-professional websites.
Our goal is to produce a chatbot which:

* [ ] answers basic navigational questions about our websites;
* [ ] answers questions about our publications; and
* [ ] uses structured CV data to answer questions about us.

Let's go!

## Requirements
  * Flask, for the webserver
  * NLTK, with the `punkt` package
  * Pybtex, for parsing .bib files
