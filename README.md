# academic-chat

Mart√≠n Villalba and Dave Howcroft's INLG 2018 hackathon repo

For the INLG 2018 hackathon, we're using flow.ai to develop a chatbot for our academic-professional websites.
Our goal is to produce a chatbot which:

[ ] answers basic navigational questions about our websites;
[ ] answers questions about our publications; and
[ ] uses structured CV data to answer questions about us.

Let's go!
